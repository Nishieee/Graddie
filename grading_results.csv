A. 7 B. 5 C. 4 D. 9 ‚ùå INCORRECT - This question was marked incorrectly.    Your answer:  | Correct answer: C üí° How to solve this correctly: Let's clarify even vs. odd numbers: Even numbers are divisible by 2 with no remainder. You can test this by seeing if you can group the number into pairs with nothing left over. For example: 4 objects can make 2 pairs (even), but 5 objects would have 1 left over (odd). The correct answer is C representing the even number.  Question 2: Question 3: What is 10 - 6? A. 2 B. 3 C. 4 D. 5 ‚ùå INCORRECT - This question was marked incorrectly.    Your answer:  | Correct answer: C üí° How to solve this correctly: Let's solve 10 - 6 together: Start with 10 and subtract (take away) 6. You can count backwards from 10: 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4. Or think of it as having 10 fingers, putting down 6 fingers, and counting how many are still up (4). The correct answer is C representing 4.  Question 3: Question 1: What is 5 + 3?

Your answer:  | Correct answer: B üí° How to solve this correctly: Let's work through this step-by-step: 5 + 3 means we start with 5 and add 3 more. You can visualize this as 5 objects plus 3 more objects = 8 total objects. Or count upward from 5: 6, 7, 8. The correct answer is B which represents 8.
